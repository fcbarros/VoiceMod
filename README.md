# VoiceMod

This is the challenge proposed by VoiceMod, I did not had much time to thing or do the project and I wish I did.
There are two programs as requested:

* ChatService: It is a .NET 5.0 Worker, using 0MQ and a Mediator, not fancy and straight forward. 
        It acceppts "--port 1234" as parameter to indicate the port number to run the chat server.
        To quit and send a quit message to the clients type "Q" and then the ENTER key.
        
* ChatClient: It is a WPF windows app that connects to the server and send messages.

There is no test done and I am not proud of that, this was just a proof of concept to display some of the code I can do.

Fell free to ask and/or comment on anything.

Both executables are in ZIP files.
